# AGENTS.md — func-console

This is the project map. Read this first, every session.

## Project

FaaS PoC UI for OpenShift Console — React + TypeScript + Webpack + PatternFly 6 + OCP Dynamic Plugin SDK.
See `docs/design/` for full design specs.

## Communication

- Ask before staring modifications of code.
- Ask before starting a new task or making a design decision.
- Once actively implementing, keep going without asking. Only stop to ask when blocked by sandbox, permissions, or ambiguous requirements.
- Always show Jira issue content (epic, story, comment) for review before creating or updating. Never push to Jira without approval.
- Default values for new issues: Assignee = unassigned, Priority = Normal, Status = Backlog. Always ask about labels before creating. Ask if defaults should be changed before creating.

## Writing Style

No em dashes (`—`). Use commas, periods, or parentheses instead.
